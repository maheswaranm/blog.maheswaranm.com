Hello World !   

Again. I look back at every time I wanted to jot down my thoughts and started.
Every time saying to myself "This is the one that becomes world-famous."  

Then, I freeze up. The fear that I might become the next [Dork](http://www.whatay.com/books/),
for [Sidin](https://twitter.com/sidin) to write about, grips me.

But then, I have so many papers with my thoughts written down. Not everything is public or will be.

This blog that you are reading now is the next trial in that long line.
This is written in [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).
And deployed on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/46d518d1ca1a). (Referral Link)

Here are some of my old trials that are still on the interwebs.

- [My Jekyll Site][1]  
  I didn't want to "migrate" this one over to Hugo.
  To keep with the "new beginnings" philosophy that led to this site, I'll keep this one "archived".  
  The posts are available on [Github](https://github.com/maheswaranm/archive.maheswaranm.com/tree/master/_posts)

- [My Wordpress Blog](https://maxthestrangerinmymirror.wordpress.com/)  
  The first blog where I wrote the most. Has not been updated in a while.  
  My personal favourites on this blog are these two.  

    [An Interview With Mr. Chikungunya](https://maxthestrangerinmymirror.wordpress.com/2009/07/26/an-interview-with-mr-chikungunya/)  
    [The Engineer Goes Vegetable Shopping](https://maxthestrangerinmymirror.wordpress.com/2009/08/18/the-enginner-goes-vegetable-shopping/)  

Check them out if you want to get a peek into how my thoughts work.

I pen down my thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maheswaranm) often.
Though that is pretty inconsistent.

Or check the list of social networks that I am in.

Hang around, you might get to know more of me.
